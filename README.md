# Solarpunk Worlds
Solarpunk is optimistic and fundamentally “high tech” and “high life”.
It emphasizes a deep integration between, rather than separation of, technology and the environment in addition to convivial conservation, self-sustainability, and social inclusiveness.


# Why take the green pill?
1. To create human thriving.
2. To pay down existential risks (decaying infrastructure).
3. To create a world your children’s children will want to live in.
4. To be a part of something bigger than yourself.
5. Because the wealth that could be used to help won’t make you any happier.
